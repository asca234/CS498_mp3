1) This is a duplicated code smell. The refactoring to fix this would be to 
extract the duplicated statements into a method to then be called in place of 
the duplicate code segments.

3) This new method likely belongs in the Jenkins class. This is a either a 
case of message chain or feature envy, possibly both. The refactoring to fix 
both of these smells would be to move the new extracted method to the Jenkins 
class, wherein it will call both the update and trim methods inside it's own 
class.
